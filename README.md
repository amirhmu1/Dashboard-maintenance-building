# Dashboard-maintenance-building
 an intelligent tool for monitoring and managing the condition of equipment and machinery that collects operational data and potential errors from various sources and displays them in the form of understandable indicators and graphs. This dashboard allows for real-time monitoring of system health, prediction of failures 
1. State Estimation & Monitoring Algorithms
Markov Models (DTMC, CTMC, Semi-Markov) – For probabilistic state transitions.
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) – Estimating hidden system states from observations.
Kalman Filters / Extended Kalman Filters – For continuous-state estimation.
